Group 1:
We learned how to set environment variables. Althoug putenv's syntax was convenient,
we discovered that it caused a memory leak.

Group 2:
We learned that there were multiple execv-type functions, and we learned about the differences
between them.

Group 3:
We learned how to use wait very thoroughly.
We used a linked list to store different process information.
We used volatile variables in our signal handler and blocked and unblocked masks in the parent
process whenever we read or changed these variables.
We learned about the difference between foreground and background processes.
We accidentally had an infinite loop in our signal handler, but were able to identify and fix
the issue quickly.
We learned about killpgid().
We learned how to use printf to format table-like outputs.
We learned that the wait function reaps zombie children.
We learned how to determine the details of how/why a process stopped or terminated.

Group 4:
We learned about piping syntax.
We learned how to redirect STDIN and STDOUT to different file locations.
We learned about broken pipe errors.
Currently, our piping doesn't work for certain functions such as "more".

Group 5:
We learned how to use time().
We learned how to use the rusgage struct.

For our man page, we learned the formatting of the man page script.
Unfortunately, we were not able to figure out how to display our man page.
We believe that we would have to make a configuration file and use this as an option when running man

Overall, our greatest obstacles were finding the correct system calls, and ensuring that we used them
how they were meant to be used.
Additionally, we did not have time to test on programs other than the Linux commands.

Enhancements:
Allow using "more" and other Linux calls.
Allow running the shell from inside the shell.
Allow input and output redirection with > and <
